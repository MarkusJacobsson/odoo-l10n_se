This is a working directory to build mainly accoun.account.template.cvs
=======================================================================

The swedish chart of accounts are published by www.bas.se. Every year we
got a new slightly different standard for the Swedish chart of account.

There are four types of companies covered by bas, K1 to K4 where K1 are the
smallest often a Egen firma, Kommanditbolag, Handelsbolag or a small AB. Sometime
called NE (Enskild näringsidkare). 

AB of a certain size, Ekonomisk förening and Stiftelse usually have to use the
"Normal" chart of account which to day are mainly for K2-companies. K3 to K4 
are still "work-in-progress" but can start with "Normal".

The smallest, K1, chart of account can be used by companies that implements
"Kontantmetoden" or "Fakturametoden" (using sales and deptors ledgers or not) and
using the method for simple closing.

Legal reports and closing methods in Sweden are using SRU-codes, this is not 
implemented in OpenERP. Instead we have implemented the rules and structure given
by SRU in the programs (below).


Minimal chart of account K1 (BAS 2015 K1)
=========================================

The origin for this chart of account are the file:

Kontoplan_K1_2015_ver1.xls

This is converted to csv in two steps (one for main accounts, and one for
sub accounts). Those files are concatenated in the "alla" file.

Kontoplan_K1_2015_ver1_alla.csv
Kontoplan_K1_2015_ver1_huvudkonton.csv
Kontoplan_K1_2015_ver1_underkonton.csv

The program create_kplank1.py reads the alla-file and implements
SRU-codes B1-B16, R1-R11 and U1-U4.

The output from this program are a part of data/account.account.template.csv


Normal chart of account K2-K4 (BAS 2015)
========================================

>>>>> Work in progress, does not function in this version <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

The origin for this chart of account are the file:

Kontoplan_Normal_2015_ver1.xls

This is converted to csv in two steps (one for main accounts, and one for
sub accounts). Those files are concatenated in the "alla" file.

Kontoplan_Normal_2015_alla.csv
Kontoplan_Normal_2015_huvudkonton.csv
Kontoplan_Normal_2015_underkontonkonton.csv

The program create_kplan.py reads the alla-file and implements
SRU-codes for Ink4-companies.


The output from this program are a part of data/account.account.template.csv

TODO
====

* The two charts should share the same account.tax.codes.template and account.tax.template
* There are several cases that is not tested with BAS 2012 K1 for example "Omvänd moms"
* SRU-codes for BAS 2012 are not correct implemented yet.
* You have to change deafult currency from EUR to SEK manually for your company before you generate
  your chart of account
* You have to manually change the length to 4 for accounts
* Your bank accounts that are generated gets the length of six instead of four and you are
  given the account number.
